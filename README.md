# My Portfolio

**My Portfolio** is a personal portfolio website built with Django. It provides information about who I am, my skills, and showcases the projects I have worked on. The website is designed to give visitors an overview of my professional journey, along with detailed descriptions of each project, technologies used, and relevant links.

## Features

- **About Me**: A section that introduces who I am, my background, and my professional journey.
- **Projects Showcase**: A collection of my personal and professional projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to live projects or code repositories.
- **Contact Form**: A simple form that allows visitors to get in touch with me for potential opportunities or collaborations.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and works well across different devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Admin Panel**: Easily manage and update portfolio content through Django's built-in admin panel.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Django**: You need to have Django installed. You can install it via pip.
- **Database**: By default, the project uses SQLite. However, you can configure it to use other databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL if needed.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/quinnmkeitel/MyPortfolio.git
    cd MyPortfolio
    ```

2. **Migrate the Database**:
    Django uses migrations to manage database schema changes. Run the following commands to apply migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3. **Create a Superuser** (optional, to access the Django admin):
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

   The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Open this URL in your browser to view the portfolio.

## Usage

1. **Browse Portfolio**: Once the server is running, visit the homepage (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`) to view the portfolio website.
2. **Admin Panel**: Access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to manage and update the portfolio content. You will need to log in using the superuser account you created earlier.
3. **Update Content**: You can update sections such as the "About Me", "Projects", and "Contact Information" through the admin interface.
4. **Contact Form**: Visitors can use the contact form to send a message, which will be forwarded to the email address set up in the Django settings.
